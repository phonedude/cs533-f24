      <p>Sierra Ferrell makes my favorite music.</p>
      <p>
        I first learned of Sierra's music in late 2018 when I was living in Arkansas. After moving
        from Virginia to Arkansas, I rented a place in the Ozarks and wanted to get familiar with the 
        sounds of folk, Bluegrass, and the local music scene. I found Sierra's music so raw that I 
        was immediately hooked. I love her voice, her lyrics, and her style. She sings from the heart 
        and her songs are amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been fortunate to see Sierra perform live and it was quite an experience. While I missed a
        show of her's that I had tickets for in Eureka Springs, AR in February 2022, I was able to see her 
        perform at the Neptune Theater in Seattle, WA in May 2023--the mixture of the vibe in the crowd, the look
        and feel of the theater, and the coming-home-ness of Sierra playing in Seattle is ineffable. This also happened to
        be the first concert that my 11 year old daughter attended. She loved it and we both had a great time! 
        We missed her again at the Seattle Zoo in August 2024 because I moved back to VA from Seattle. And sadly I will
        miss her again this weekend in Raleigh, NC. If it sounds like she's busy just based on the dates I've missed her, 
        it's because she is! She's been touring non-stop and will be headed to Austrailia in 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than her soulfoul voice, style, and guitar playing, I love that she's a great story teller. In my
        opinion this is what makes a songwriter great, in particular a musician in the folk/bluegrass genre. 
        And of course I'm not alone in my opinion--in the past decade she has gone from busking at Pike Place Market 
        in Seattle to playing the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. She's a friend of Dolly Parton and has been on stage 
        with some of the greatest musicians of our era.
