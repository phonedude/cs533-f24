      <p>Carter Beauford is my favorite drummer.</p>
      <p>
        Drummers are musicians and Carter is my favorite because of how musical he is. That said,
        Carter is a "drummer's" drummer. He is a master of his craft and has an open style of playing that's
        unmatchable (left-hand lead on a right-hand kit)--the result of watching Buddy Rich on TV at
        such a young age (two years old) he didn't realize, when he set the drums up to mirror Buddy's kit,
        he was actually training himself to play left-handed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this simple "mistake," Carter began a journey of drumming with less restriction --
        his unique style affording an ambidextrous ability to easily move around the drums and fludily
        play beats no matter which hand played which drum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oddly almost a footnote in his storied musical career (playing with the likes of legends such as
        Victor Wooten and Bela Fleck), for those who aren't aware, he is the long-time drummer for the Dave Matthews Band.
