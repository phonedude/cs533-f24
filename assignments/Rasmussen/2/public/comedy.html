      <p>Shane Gillis is my favorite comedian.</p>
      <p>
        Shane Gillis is funny. While that is an obvious reason to like a comedian, 
        I think the risks he takes balancing being offensive and being funny, 
        how he uses his position to help his friends find success, and how he 
        employs (often uncomfortable) aspects of U.S. History in his jokes are 
        what makes him stand out among other comedians of his age and cohort.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who aren't aware, Shane was a cast member on
        <em>Saturday Night Live</em> for a week. He was fired before the season
        started when it was discovered that he had used racist slurs and made
        homophobic jokes on a podcast years prior to being cast on SNL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since being fired from SNL, he has been a guest on many podcasts, has a
        podcast of his own, has a show on Netflix called <em>Tires</em> and,
        after apologizing for his insensitive jokes, was even invited back to
        <em>Saturday Night Live</em> to host an episode.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I like the image of him at the Mall of America because I
        have performed stand-up comedy at that club and bombed so hard with my
        own poorly thought out, badly timed, insensitive jokes that I was never
        able to find the courage to get back on stage after the MC chastised me
        and the crowd turned. While Shane has definitely said things in
        his past that are offensive and regrettable, I think he is a good
        example of how someone can learn from their mistakes, grow as a person,
        and work to comeback from life's setbacks--for him that meant getting
        back up on stage, contiuing to tell risky jokes (with a new found
        sensitivity to his podcast content), make people laugh, and do what he loves.
