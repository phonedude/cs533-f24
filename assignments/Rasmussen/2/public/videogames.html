      <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is my favorite videogame.</p>
      <p>
        Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world action role-playing game set in the dystopian "Night City," 
        a huge map that hosts a load of characters obsessed with power, weaponry, vehicles, 
        and body modification. My character V is a mercenary trying to survive and thrive in 
        the Cyber landscape. Keanu Reeves makes an appearance as character Johnny Silverhand, 
        which lends a cool rock-star vibe to the game.

        While the game itself is probably my favorite videogame of all time, namely
        because of how many different things you can do in the game and because of the mix 
        of rugged and futuristic "Cyberpunk" esthetics, which appeals to my love of
        technology. The best part of the game for me are the Inception-like qualities--one 
        of the coolest easter eggs that I have found in the game are these game-within-a game 
        video games that you can play when you walk up to an arcade machine at a bar. Indeed,
        they are fun enough that I have spent hours playing them instead of the main game lol.
