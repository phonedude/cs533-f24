The assignment was to create a web server listening on port 4000 with 4 subdirectories


The urls that are suported by the website are:
* localhost:4000
* localhost:4000/Loki

    Displays Loki.hml
* localhost:4000/AllThingsGood

    Displays AllThingsGood.hml
* localhost:4000/JeffWilliams

    Displays JeffWilliams.hml
* localhost:4000/Aviators

    Displays Aviators.hml
* localhost:4000/Cookies

    Displays all Cookies that have been sent by the website

This web server requires node.js, express, and cookie parser to be installed to run.


* The video of the files and test completion pages is available at: [https://youtu.be/kF48t0t9Ehc](https://youtu.be/kF48t0t9Ehc)
