# Problems that occured

* dynamically loaded sites like reddit being difficult to recreate properly if I saved the dynamic copy and not the static copy of the html
* setting access="post.php" was not as simple as it seemed and would either go to "post.php" or would not run with the login information. In the end I used a post responce in the server file to save the login information.
* getting the website all the necessary .css and png files required the creation of several new pages to the website. The solution likely could have been more compact but instead I chose a quick and dirty method copy and pasting most the information.
