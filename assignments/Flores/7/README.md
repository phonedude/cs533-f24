# Assignment 7: Phishing Site

## Description
This project demonstrates a phishing site that convincingly mimics the **20minutos.es** website to capture login credentials. The phishing site is hosted using Node.js, with all resources served locally to maintain authenticity. It also includes a fake dashboard that users are redirected to after entering their credentials, enhancing the realism of the phishing attack.

## Features
- Captures and logs user credentials (username and password) to `credentials.log`.
- Redirects users to a **fake dashboard** after login, with a dynamic greeting based on the entered username.
- Fully functional login form styled to resemble the original site.
- All images, styles, and scripts are served locally for better replication of the original website.

## Files
- `server.js`: Node.js server to handle requests and log credentials.
- `public/index.html`: Main phishing page HTML.
- `public/fake-dashboard.html`: Fake dashboard displayed after login.
- `public/css/styles.css`: Styles for the phishing page and dashboard.
- `public/images`: Contains all images (e.g., logos, article thumbnails).
- `credentials.log`: Log file storing captured usernames and passwords.

## Challenges
- Accurately mimicking the layout and styling of the original **20minutos.es** website.
- Ensuring all resources (CSS, images, fonts, etc.) are hosted locally for seamless rendering.
- Implementing a dynamic fake dashboard that personalizes the user experience.
